## A little about me

Hi! My name is Anni Pan, and I'm now a (rising) sophomore studying Computer and Information Science and Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. As a member of the class of 2023, there still remains a lot at Penn for me to explore. 

## Bio

### Geography
* My hometown is Nanjing, China, where I spent my first 18 years.
* My home in the US is Chantilly, Virginia.
* When the semester starts, I will be in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
* My favorite city is Hangzhou, China, where I want to buy a big house and live with my best friends.

### Fun Facts
* I enjoy listening to Chopin while coding.
* I taught myself Adobe Premiere and made a [fancut](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xK411s7me?from=search&seid=17706359169206564063) for my favorite actor!
* I'm lactose intolerant so I can't eat dairy products.
* My Chinese and English name are literally the same.
* I love singing but I can't read sheet music smoothly :(
* I first started learning coding when I was 10, then dropped it and started again when I was 18. That's a long time span.
